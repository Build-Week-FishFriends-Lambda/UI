                      <h2>What is FishFriends?</h2>

                      <p>I hate figuring out where the fishing hot spots are around me. And the apps that currently exist like <a href="https://dwrapps.utah.gov/fishing/fStart">https://dwrapps.utah.gov/fishing/fStart</a> are all built by governments who don't really emphasize product and user experience. I need an app where I can log my fishing day, what types of bait I used, how many fish of which species I caught and what time of the day I was out there. FishFriends makes all of this possible.</p>
