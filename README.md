Proposal

What problem does your app solve?
I hate figuring out where the fishing hot spots are around me. And the apps that currently exist like https://dwrapps.utah.gov/fishing/fStart are all built by governments who don't really emphasize product and user experience. I need an app where I can log my fishing day, what types of bait I used, how many fish of which species I caught and what time of the day I was out there. 


Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
Fishfriends disrupts the information moat around fishing information and make it easy to share information (or misinformation) as desired with regards to fishing. It provides a geographic touchpoint for free, frictionless information sharing.
What is the mission statement?
Connect people using a modern implementation of the rich tradition of fishing. Fishfriends aims to democratize access to fishing advice and bring the social joy of “fish stories” to anyone with a smartphone.

Fishing Log on Google Play - Allows photos and records of catches to be posted to a map
Anglers Log - Google Play - Allows fishing logs with optional sharing and geocaching


Design - Planning

Optional but highly recommended Please refer to this document:
Build Weeks: Planning & Design Worksheet (How to build a beautiful application)
What design system will you use?
-Ant Design
What will your user flow be?


What is the URL to your wireframes?


Frameworks - Libraries

What 3rd party frameworks/libraries are you considering using?
Ant Design, Semantic UI


Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access?
No


Are you required to pay to use the API?
No


Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?)
	No



Target Audience

Who is your target audience? Be specific.
Fishermen and women with a desire to connect and share information.
What feedback have you gotten from potential users?
“I’m not giving away my secrets!”
“I’d only use that if I was travelling… my local spots are for me and me only!”
“I don’t want a busy lake, I’d only use that app to send people on a wild goose chase!”
Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?

We have decided that the issue of sharing information is likely a point of friction for users, and we have embraced that by adding no validation mechanics and allowing users to choose if they’re spreading real information or misinformation.

Research

Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
Prototype Key Feature(s)

This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
